<h4>Design Thinking is a human-centered, problem-solving approach that encourages creativity, innovation,
     and practical solutions. The course is designed to help students develop the ability to understand user
      needs, redefine problems, and generate ideas that lead to impactful results. Unlike traditional problem

      -solving methods, Design Thinking focu
      ses on empathy and experimentation, making it especially relevant in today’s fast-changing world.

    The course typically covers five major stages: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and
     Test. Students learn to engage with real users, analyze their experiences, and identify core
      challenges. Through brainstorming, they generate multiple ideas and later convert those ideas 
      nto prototypes that can be tested and refined. This iterative process ensures that solutions are no
      t only innovative but also practical and user-friendly.
